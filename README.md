# Overview

An app that lets users search for movies from the [Open Movie Database API](https://www.omdbapi.com/) and add movies to their personal watchlist.

This is a project from the [Frontend Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend) by Scrimba.

## Scrimba project requirements

- Two pages -  index.html and watchlist.html
- Index = search page. Calls to OMDB API with the title searched for and displays search results
- Button to “add to watchlist” which saves the data to local storage
- Watchlist.html loads and displays data from local storage

## What I learnt

- Nested APIs using async/await syntax (avoid nested fetches if possible 😵‍💫)
- using `addEventListener` to add a add/remove button for each movie card components
